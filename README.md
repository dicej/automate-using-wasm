# Automate Using WASM

Why ti create this becuase this is the main selling point of the wasi to be able to create logic indenendent of the language and highly decoplied ways and with low latency and low footprint (Env Sustabanle ;>)

## Skills to be achieved
- use of wasm in real world uscase of FAAS
- python openai,
- rust cli
- watttime api

## Goal 1

- [x] Achieved?

Create a CLI in Rust which can take users input and make it runable
> Hint: use clappy

THings it should be able to perform
- User input
- command line input
- Environment variable get
- write a location

## Goal 2

- [x] Achieved?

- Password generator (Python)

## Goal 3

- [x] Achieved?

Integrate the above two goals [1](#goal-1) [2](#goal-2)

## Goal 4

- [x] Achieved?

Github Api based wit and implementation which we can use in the cli to perform some operations

1. Expectation get the latest release
- org:repo and the other things
2. Openai api usage (TODO)

## Goal 5

- [ ] Achieved?

Integrate the above two goals [3](#goal-3) [4](#goal-4)


## Goal 6

- [ ] Achieved?

- Use wattime api
- IMage generation using the openai things here [Repo Link](https://gitlab.com/dipankardas011/llm-usage/)

https://docs.watttime.org/


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Finally deploy using these in a docker container and runtimeclass in K8s
